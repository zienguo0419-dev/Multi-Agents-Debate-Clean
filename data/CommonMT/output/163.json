The phrase \"十几年\" in Chinese can indeed refer to a range of numbers between 10 and 19, indicating more than ten but less than twenty. In English, the expression \"over a decade\" effectively conveys this idea of a period exceeding ten years without specifying an exact number within that range.\n2. While the use of \"的\" after \"十几年前\" in the Chinese text does indicate possession or modification, the term \"over a decade ago\" still accurately captures the essence of the movie being from a time period more than ten years in the past. This translation maintains the intended meaning while also sounding more natural and idiomatic in English.\n\nTherefore, I argue that \"I watched a movie from over a decade ago\" is the most appropriate and faithful translation in this context."
